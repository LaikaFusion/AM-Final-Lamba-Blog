## Detailed Analysis

Settings page css

##### Github
[Mobile CSS](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-stock-trainer/pull/100)


* Replaced favicon with a CC one and added attribution
Our current favicon turned out to be from a site that required payment. Luckily an almost identical one is located in the font-awesome library which is CC licenesed


* Added attribution to landing page
This just added a link to where we got our front page image. It was also CC0 licenesed.


* Made reports page work on horizontal mobile pages, and other small browser windows
This was more of an extensive change. The reports page was made to work on horizontal phones. Everything is height dependent on the page so the only way to do it was make the page scrollable. 


* Added a bit of styling to the billing page so it matched the rest of the site
We recieved this feedback from Brian to make to replace the unstyled button on this page.
